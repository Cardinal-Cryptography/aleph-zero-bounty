# Aleph Zero Bounty

## Recommended direction 1

### DeFi/Degen
Create innovative financial applications using ink!

Besides offering unique ZK features, Aleph Zero is a layer 1 platform with a growing DeFi ecosystem. As the design of our privacy framework is such that it allows for an easy integration with regular DeFi primitives, in this track we encourage you to leverage Aleph Zero's robust infrastructure and create unique financial solutions that help expand the ecosystem's functionality.

## Recommended direction 2

### ZK/Privacy

Use Aleph Zero’s on-chain SNARK verification abilities in order to build a solution that benefits from privacy in unique ways.

Using ZK SNARKs enables exploring enhanced privacy in the blockchain, and we challenge you to use it to develop a solution that benefits from the added privacy in a non-obvious way. Solutions can include DeFi applications that economically benefit from enhanced privacy, private DAOs and solutions targeting non-blockchain specific use cases.
We encourage you to think outside the box and explore innovative ways to leverage Aleph Zero's privacy-enhancing technology. You can create a unique value proposition that differentiates your solution from the others on the market. So put on your thinking cap, and let's see what you can come up with!

Important note: only one fixed Circuit Config is now supported for on-chain verification -- Standard Plonk with one gate -- this will be soon extended too arbitrary halo2 circuits. You can work on devnet or locally and, importantly: start with [this repo](https://github.com/Cardinal-Cryptography/rsa-challenge-with-halo2).

## Recommended direction 3

### Tooling/Infrastructure

Create developer/infrastructure tooling for the Aleph Zero Ecosystem.

In this track, we challenge you to create valuable developer and infrastructure tooling that supports the Aleph Zero Ecosystem. Whether it's ink!-specific tooling, wallets, integrations, or contract deployment/lifecycle management, we want to see solutions that make it easier for developers to build on Aleph Zero, and for regular users to use it. 
We're looking for solutions that solve real-world challenges and streamline the development process. Your submission could be a new IDE integration for ink! or a platform to manage smart contract deployment and lifecycle management. Or perhaps you have an innovative idea for a wallet or integration that simplifies user adoption.
Our goal is to make Aleph Zero as developer-friendly as possible, and your contribution can play a significant role in achieving that. So, let your creativity flow and start building tools that empower developers to create innovative solutions on our platform.

## Judging criteria

We’ll be judging the solutions in the following areas:
* **Fit for the Aleph Zero ecosystem**: we are looking for solutions that will help our ecosystem grow and become more diverse. We require the solutions to either have the potential of becoming products deployed on the Aleph Zero chain, help create such products or showcase the abilities of the network in some way.
* **Innovation & uniqueness**: we value projects that are not mere copies of well-known ideas but are an effect of the team’s creative spark and collaboration.
* **Usability**: even the most ingenious solution will not be a success if it’s not encouraging its usage. Note, however, that a user might mean very different things: an end user, a developer, a company, etc.
* **Correctness and technical ingenuity**: we are a bunch of technical people and therefore are fascinated by elegant solutions to problems. Additionally, especially in the blockchain space, correctness and safety are crucial.

That said, please remember that except for the first criterion, we will accept solutions that sacrifice one of the points to shine in the others. For example: if you have an amazing technical solution but don’t have the time to make it convenient for the users, don’t hesitate to submit it anyway!
